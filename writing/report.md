### Discussion on librry resources
Please respond to the following questions using about four (4) sentences for each. Please be sure to remove the `TODO` tags on each line as you work.


 - Which resources or services of the library did you research? Why were you attracted to these ones?
  I researched the tutoring/consulting sessions that take place on the main floor in the library towards the back.The hours range from 7pm-11pm, depending on the subject. I was attracted to this because everyone can benefit from this one way or another. Even if you understand the topic, it doesn't hurt to hear someone else's point of view.



 - Which one resource or service do you think would be especially important to your studying process? In your discussion, please reflect on how the absence of this particular resource or service would be detrimental to your scholarship?
 Tutoring and Consulting is very crucial to my studying process. It is important to me to review the information that I just learned. It is also very beneficial to have someone there whenever you have questions about a certain topic. If this resource was not available, it would be harder to grasp certain concepts.



 - Who else can benefit from this resource or service and why? Please reflect on what kinds of problems can be resolved by its use.
All students can benefit from this. Even if you understand the topic, you can still use this for review. Talking to someone else mihgt open your eyes up to something new. In addition, if you are having a hard time with the topic, these tutors can break it down to you so you understand.


 - How does the library maintain this resource or service? For instance, is it free or is there some cost necessary?
Students do not have to pay to receive tutoring. If you want a more in depth one-on-one tutoring session, there is a request form to fill out on Alleghenyâ€™s website. However, there is also a drop-in schedule that shows times where students can come unannounced. Free tutoring is very helpful to students on campus.



 - Are there any disadvantages associated with this resource or service?
If you have more free time in the morning than in the evening it can be tricky trying to go to a tutoring session. Since the hours range from 7pm-11pm, people that are busy during this time will not be able to make it. I suggest emailing 
"studentsuccess@allegheny.edu", to see if you can work around that. You might be able to contact someone to disscus other times you can meet.
